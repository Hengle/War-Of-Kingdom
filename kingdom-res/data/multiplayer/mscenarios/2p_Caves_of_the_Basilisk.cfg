It was his lake, no other's, and though it was not large, he was its master. Then, the Basilisk came, and looked into the Serpent's eyes. And the Serpent had not died, but it was no longer alive. Thus the new lord of the lake had arrived.

Now all that is left is a stark reminder of his once great bearing and strength.

According to the legend, the weapon rested somewhere on the bottom of this very lake (Ruaskkolin Lake, named for a well-known Sea Serpent who made it his home). Having prepared himself for battle with the Serpent, Rilhon met with two rather large surprises. The first was the petrified form of Ruaskkolin the Serpent. The second was the very-much-alive Chak'kso Ney'yks, who was, oddly enough, in possession of all of his teeth.

blue and white
she pulled and pushed the tides
and taught the fishes how to speak to planets
silver green
with magic
running from her spirit into skins of kelp and shells of snails
a twisting of her tail and hands
she sent her songs to run on pin-tipped legs about the sands
and now
and now the strangest pause
for years and years
she hasn't moved her eyes
