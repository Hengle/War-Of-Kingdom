The attacker and defender alternate strikes until each has used their allotted number of strikes. The attacker chooses one of its weapons to attack with, and the defender retaliates with one of its attacks of the same type. There are two types of attacks: melee, which usually involves weapons such as swords, axes or fangs; and ranged, which usually involves weapons such as bows, spears and fireballs."

msgid "In combat, your units will inevitably take damage. When a unit <ref>dst='experience_and_advancement' text='advances'</ref>, it will heal fully. This can happen as you finish fighting an enemy, whether it is your turn or not. Wesnoth offers several other ways for your units to heal, all of which take place at the beginning of your turn, before you take action."
msgstr ""

msgid "In some scenarios, parts of the map will be hidden from you. There are two mechanisms that can be used separately or together. The Shroud hides both the terrain and any units at a location. However, once it is cleared, you can always see that location. The Fog of War only hides units and ownership of villages (other than by you or your allies). The Fog of War is cleared temporarily when you have units nearby, but returns when they leave. Both the Shroud and the Fog of War are cleared by units. Each unit clears locations adjacent to those within one turn’s move (ignoring zones of control and enemy units).

Normally you can undo a unit’s movement, as long as an event with a randomized result has not occurred, such as combat or recruitment (as most units receive random traits when recruited). Exploring hidden terrain by clearing Shroud or Fog will also prevent undos to a previous state. You may wish to activate ‘delay shroud updates’ in the actions menu. This will prevent units from clearing Shroud or Fog until the next randomized event or a manual update via ‘update shroud now’ (or the end of your turn) and thereby perserve your ability to undo movement."
