"the Shroud and the Fog of War are cleared by units. Each unit clears "
"locations adjacent to those within one turn’s move (ignoring zones of "

"  Normally you can undo a unit’s movement, as long as an event with a "
"randomized result has not occurred, such as combat or recruitment (as most "
"units receive random traits when recruited). Exploring hidden terrain by "
"clearing Shroud or Fog will also prevent undos to a previous state. You may "

"  Each unit has a certain number of hitpoints (HP). If the hitpoints of a "
"unit drop below 1, the unit dies. Each unit also has a certain number of "
"experience points (XP). A freshly recruited unit starts with no experience "
"points, and gains experience by fighting enemies.\n"
"\n"
"  The hitpoints and experience points are both indicated in the status pane "
"using two numbers (the current value and the maximum value the unit can "
"have).\n"
"\n"
"  The hitpoints are also indicated by an energy bar next to each unit, which "
"is green, yellow or red. A unit with at least 1 experience point has a blue "
"experience bar, which turns white as the unit is about to "
"<ref>dst='experience_and_advancement' text='advance'</ref>.\n"
"\n"
"Experience and Advancement\n"
"If both units survive a combat, they gain a number of experience points "
"equal to the level of the unit they’re fighting. If a unit kills another in "
"combat, however, it gains much more experience: 4 for a level 0 unit, 8 for "
"level 1, 16 for level 2, 24 for level 3, and so forth.\n"
"\n"
"Units have a certain amount of experience required to advance (this is 20% "
"less for units with the Intelligent trait). Once they achieve this amount, "
"they immediately advance to the next level, healing fully in the process. In "
"some cases, you will be given a choice of advancement options.\n"
"\n"
"While most units have three levels, not all do. Occasional units (such as "
"<ref>dst='unit_Mage' text='Magi'</ref>) may have four. Once a unit has "
"reached its maximum level, it may have an After Maximum Level Advancement "
"(AMLA) available to it. The AMLA will modify the unit each time the unit "
"reaches the experience goal, but the unit will remain the same level. The "
"typical AMLA effect is for the unit to raise the maximum HP by 3 and full-"
"heal it. The first AMLA will normally be reached with 150 XP gained (120 XP "
"for intelligent units). However, gaining an AMLA becomes progressively "
"harder for each AMLA the unit receives, and so it is usually more useful to "
"try to advance your lower level units.\n"
"\n"
"Healing\n"
"In combat, your units will inevitably take damage. When a unit "
"<ref>dst='experience_and_advancement' text='advances'</ref>, it will heal "
"fully. This can happen as you finish fighting an enemy, whether it is your "
"turn or not. Wesnoth offers several other ways for your units to heal, all "
"of which take place at the beginning of your turn, before you take action.\n"
"\n"
"Resting: A unit which neither moves, attacks, nor is attacked will heal 2 HP "
"in its next turn.\n"
"\n"
"Villages: A unit which starts a turn in a village will heal 8HP.\n"
"\n"
"<ref>dst='ability_regenerates' text='Regeneration'</ref>: Certain units "
"(such as trolls) will automatically heal 8HP every turn.\n"
"\n"
"Healing units: Units with the <ref>dst='ability_heals +4' text='Heals'</ref> "
"ability will heal each allied adjacent unit, usually <ref>dst='ability_heals "

"healing, if it has that ability as well).\n"
"\n"
"Resting can be combined with other forms of healing, but villages, "

"<header>text='Movement'</header>\n"
"  Movement in <italic>text='War of Kingdom'</italic> is simple. Click on the "
"unit you wish to move to select it, then click on the hex you wish to move "
"it to. When a unit is selected, everywhere it can move this turn will be "
"highlighted, and all other hexes on the map are made dull. Mousing over a "
"highlighted hex shows the defense rating the unit would have if you moved it "
"to that hex. Mousing over a dull hex will also show the number of turns "
"required to reach it, and clicking will cause the unit to move towards it by "
"the fastest route over this and subsequent turns. If you don’t use up all of "
"a unit’s movement when you first move a unit, you may move it again. This is "
"useful when having two units switch places. Attacking with a unit will use "
"up its movement. Ending a move in a village you don’t already own will also "
"use up a unit’s movement, but will still allow it to attack.\n"
"\n"
"  Each unit has a certain number of movement points which are used up when "
"moving into a new hex, depending on the Terrain of that particular hex. For "
"instance, grassland nearly always costs 1 movement point to enter. Exactly "
"how many movement points are spent entering a hex depends on the unit type — "
"in forest, elvish units only spend 1 movement point, most human and orc "
"units spend 2, while horsemen spend 3. You can learn how many movement "
"points a unit requires to enter a certain terrain type by right-clicking on "
"it, selecting Unit Description, and then looking at <italic>text='Terrain "
"Modifiers'</italic>.\n"
"\n"
"  Another thing to keep in mind while moving is Zones of Control. Each unit "
"generates a zone of control in the hexes immediately surrounding it, and any "
"enemy unit entering those hexes immediately ends its movement. Learning how "
"to use zones of control to your advantage is an important part of Wesnoth, "
"as only <ref>dst='ability_skirmisher' text='Skirmishers'</ref> can ignore "
"zones of control.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Shroud and Fog of War'</header>\n"
"  In some scenarios, parts of the map will be hidden from you. There are two "
"mechanisms that can be used separately or together. The Shroud hides both "
"the terrain and any units at a location. However, once it is cleared, you "
"can always see that location. The Fog of War only hides units and ownership "
"of villages (other than by you or your allies). The Fog of War is cleared "
"temporarily when you have units nearby, but returns when they leave. Both "
"the Shroud and the Fog of War are cleared by units. Each unit clears "
"locations adjacent to those within one turn’s move (ignoring zones of "
"control and enemy units).\n"
"\n"
"  Normally you can undo a unit’s movement, as long as an event with a "
"randomized result has not occurred, such as combat or recruitment (as most "
"units receive random traits when recruited). Exploring hidden terrain by "
"clearing Shroud or Fog will also prevent undos to a previous state. You may "
"wish to activate ‘delay shroud updates’ in the actions menu. This will "
"prevent units from clearing Shroud or Fog until the next randomized event or "
"a manual update via ‘update shroud now’ (or the end of your turn) and "
"thereby perserve your ability to undo movement."

"Combat in <italic>text='War of Kingdom'</italic> always takes place between "
"units in adjacent hexes. Click on your unit, and click on the enemy you want "
"to attack: your unit will move towards the enemy unit, and when they are "
"next to each other, combat will begin. The attacker and defender alternate "
"strikes until each has used their allotted number of strikes. The attacker "
"chooses one of its weapons to attack with, and the defender retaliates with "
"one of its attacks of the same type. There are two types of attacks: melee, "
"which usually involves weapons such as swords, axes or fangs; and ranged, "
"which usually involves weapons such as bows, spears and fireballs.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Order and number of strikes'</header>\n"
"The attacker gets the first strike, then the defender retaliates. Each "
"strike either hits, doing a given amount of damage, or misses, doing no "
"damage at all. Strikes alternate until each unit has used up all of its "
"strikes. The number of strikes a unit has varies; for instance, an Elvish "
"fighter with a 5–4 attack may strike 4 times, each successful strike dealing "
"5 damage, while an Orcish Grunt with a 9–2 attack can only strike twice (but "
"at 9 damage for each hit).\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Chance to hit'</header>\n"
"Every unit has a chance of being hit, based on the Terrain it is in. This is "
"shown in the status pane, and may also be found by right-clicking a unit, "
"selecting Unit Description, and then looking at <italic>text='Terrain "
"Modifiers'</italic>. For instance, many elves have a defense rating of 70% "
"in forest, so a unit attacking them has only a 30% chance of hitting. "
"Conversely, the elf’s chance of hitting the attacker in return depends on "
"what terrain the attacker is in.\n"
"\n"
"There are two exceptions to this rule: <ref>dst='weaponspecial_magical' "
"text='Magical attacks'</ref> and <ref>dst='weaponspecial_marksman' "
"text='Marksmen'</ref>. Magical attacks always have a 70% chance to hit, "
"regardless of terrain, and, when used offensively, Marksmen always have at "
"least a 60% chance to hit, regardless of terrain.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text=Damage</header>\n"
"Each strike which hits causes a base amount of damage depending on the "
"attack type. For instance, an Elvish Fighter with a 5–4 attack does 5 base "
"damage. This is usually modified by two things: "
"<ref>dst='damage_types_and_resistance' text='Resistance'</ref> and "
"<ref>dst='time_of_day' text='Time of Day'</ref>. To see how base damage is "
"modified by the circumstances, select <italic>text='Damage Calculations'</"
"italic> in the attack selection menu.\n"
"\n"
"A few units have special <ref>dst='..abilities_section' text='abilities'</"
"ref> which affect damage dealt in combat. The most common of these is "
"<ref>dst='weaponspecial_charge' text='Charge'</ref>, which doubles the "
"damage dealt by both attacker and defender when the unit with Charge "
"attacks.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text=Damage Types and Resistance</header>\n"
"In Wesnoth, there are three types of damage usually associated with physical "
"attacks: Blade, Pierce and Impact damage. Additionally, there are three "
"further types of damage usually associated with magical attacks: Fire, Cold "
"and Arcane attacks. Different units may have resistances which alter the "
"damage which they take from certain damage types.\n"
"\n"
"Resistances work very simply: if a unit has 40% resistance against a damage "
"type, then it will suffer 40% less damage when hit with that damage type. It "
"is also possible for a unit to be vulnerable against some damage types. If a "
"unit has -100% resistance against a damage type, it will suffer 100% more "
"damage when hit by that type.\n"
"\n"
"For example, Skeletons are highly resistant to Blade and Pierce damage, but "
"are vulnerable to Impact and Fire damage, and extremely vulnerable to Arcane "
"damage."
